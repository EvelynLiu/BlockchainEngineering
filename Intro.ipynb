    "# Digital services \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For many decades researchers and industry tried to build a secure and private digital services. For example, a protocl that allow to interact with a bank in anonymous way. Such solution makes sense when:\n",
    "- Individuals rely on the regulatory enviroment \n",
    "- When there is a threat when illegal action is observed \n",
    "\n",
    "How can you build such service over the internet? What if your service is in another country? In a mission-critical/Byzantine enviorment? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Decentralized enviorments \n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge is to co-ordinate number of individuals even in the absence of a strong regulatory enviorment. \n",
    "Beacuse we cannot rely on any particular individual that makes such system highly robust and accessable to anyone having a connection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However building such services over decentrlized evnoirments introudces some number of challenges that are not present in central services:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All participants are usually not fully connected. All communication is through a \"communication graph\". How to build a robust communication graph? \n",
    "2. Processes are allowed to be offline. Opt-out and rejoin later to the system \n",
    "3. There are financial incentives to behave in many non-trivial ways. *Example*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To work in such envoirment one must first assume the maximum number of malicious participants in the network. \n",
    "$f$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More challenges: \n",
    "- You cannot rely on certain peer being always honest - i.e. executing the same code. \n",
    "- Achieving privacy is harder\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bitcoin model \n",
    "\n",
    "Achieves a distributed consensus among individuals despite challenges. \n",
    "The consensus is split in rounds. At each round peers collect transactions and append a list of *non-confirmed* transactions to the list of all transactions. Such list of transaction is usually called *block*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each transaction goes through a validation to get into the *block*. For example, for a payment system, the validation protocol ensures that balance of the payer is not negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Ledger* - state at time $t$. To calculate state peer goes through all ledgers up to the current time and applies transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "Alice at round i wants to pay to Bob. Alice signs a message $(pay, Alice, Bob, 1, id)_{Bob}$\n",
    "Alice gossips to the neighbours the transaction. So that this transaction is spread through the network. \n",
    "At the end to the round i a random leader is elected - say Charlie.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Charlie is honest, he will include Alice's transaction to the newest block and links the block to the latest known block, thus forming a chain and a new ledger $L_i = B_i -> B_{i-1} -> ... -> L_0$  \n",
    "\n",
    "That indicates that a random peer in the network has received and verified the transaction. Is that enough? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Security of the Bitcoin comes from the following: \n",
    " - Charlie cant make Bob or Alice pay, because each transaction requires a signature to get accepted. \n",
    " - In worst case Charlie can ignore the transaction. If we assume that $f < N/2$, Alice will progress at least in half of the cases. \n",
    " \n",
    "**Assumptions**:\n",
    "- Cryptography assumption \n",
    "- Unbiased random leader selection that is fair \n",

    "## Payment  systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with a currency in real life is that they are unforgable and difficult to replicate. Usually it is a physical object acting as a marker with some value. The value has only nominal meaning and the value is creating dure to belief that this currency can be spend later. In digital and decentralized space creating such marker is an hard problem, mainly due to the \"copying\" problem of the marker. One can reuse the same token with multiple peer knowing that these peers are not communicating with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can formalize payment system with a \"Marker problem\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Participants can hold marker\n",
    "2. When marker is transfered the holder loses it.\n",
    "3. Receiver knows the Sender when the marker is received\n",
    "\n",
    "Security guarantees: \n",
    "1. At most one process should be marked\n",
    "2. If honest peer received it from another honest peer - the event happend\n",
    "3. If peer received a chain ending with P - it is now marked\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexities: \n",
